# python_IS_mine Repository

## Description

Welcome to the `python_IS_mine` repository. Although no specific description is provided, the repository mainly consists of various Python script files that cover a range of Python programming concepts, from basic syntax and data types to more complex topics like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. This repository could serve as a valuable resource for Python learners or anyone looking to brush up their Python skills.

## Installation

Given the nature of the project as a collection of Python scripts, no specific installation is needed. The Python files can be executed directly on any system with Python installed. If you don't have Python installed, follow the instructions on the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

To use any of the Python scripts, clone the repository to your local machine and execute the desired script using Python. For example, to run the `01_print.py` script, navigate to the directory containing the script and use the command:

```bash
python 01_print.py
```

## Repository Structure

The `python_IS_mine` repository consists of 29 files, all located in the root directory. The file types range from Python scripts to a README file and a text file. The Python scripts are named in a manner that indicates the Python concept they cover. For instance, `01_print.py` likely deals with print statements in Python, while `18_inheritance.py` could be demonstrating the concept of inheritance in Python.

## Key Directories and Files

Since all files are in the root directory, there are no sub-directories to discuss. However, it's worth mentioning some key Python scripts that may be of interest:

- `14_functions.py`: Likely explains how to define and use functions in Python.
- `17_class.py`: A script related to Python classes and Object-Oriented Programming.
- `20_polymorphism.py`: Demonstrates the concept of polymorphism in Python.
- `28_filehandling.py`: A script showing how to handle files in Python.

## Frameworks and Libraries
