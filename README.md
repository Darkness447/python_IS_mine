# python_IS_mine

## Description
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts demonstrating different aspects of Python programming language. The scripts range from basic print commands to more advanced concepts like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Installation
As these are standalone Python scripts, no specific installation is required. However, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage
Each file in the repository demonstrates a unique aspect of Python. You can run each Python file using the command:

```bash
python filename.py
```
Replace 'filename.py' with the name of the file you want to run.
