# python_IS_mine

## Project Description
The `python_IS_mine` repository is an assortment of Python scripts demonstrating different aspects of Python programming. From basic print functionality to complex topics like polymorphism, this repository offers a wide range of Python scripts for learning and reference.

## Installation
As the project consists of independent Python scripts, no particular installation is required. All you need is a Python environment to run these scripts. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage
You can run these scripts in any Python environment. Here is a general example of how to execute them:
```
python 01_print.py
```
Replace `01_print.py` with the script you want to run.

## Repository Structure
This repository contains the following files:

- 01_print.py
- 02_comment.py
- 03_variable.py
- 04_types.py
- 05_strings.py
- 06_Booleans.py
- 07_list.py
- 08_listc.py
- 09_tuples.py
- 10_sets.py
- 11_dict.py
- 12_ifelse.py
- 13_loops.py
- 14_functions.py
- 15_lambda.py
- 16_array.py
- 17_class.py
- 18_inheritance.py
- 19_iterator.py
- 20_polymorphism.py
- 21_Modules.py
- 22_datetime.py
- 23_Math.py
- 24_Json.py
- 25_pip.py
- 26_input.py
- 27_stringFormat.py
- 28_filehandling.py
- darkness.txt

Each Python script (`.py` file) covers a particular topic or functionality in Python, and `darkness.txt` is a text file possibly used for file handling examples.

## Key Directories and Their Purpose
