# python_IS_mine

## Description
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts aimed at explaining and demonstrating various concepts of Python programming language. The scripts cover a wide range of topics from basic syntax, data types, structures, control flow to advanced topics like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and file handling.

## Installation
Since the repository consists of Python scripts only, ensure that Python is installed on your machine. If not, follow the instructions below:

1. Download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/
2. Verify the installation by running `python --version` on your terminal/command prompt.

## Usage
Each script in the repository demonstrates a specific Python concept or functionality. You can run any script by navigating to the repository directory and using the Python command followed by the script name. For example:

```
python 01_print.py
```

## Repository Structure
The repository consists of a single directory at the root level. This directory contains several Python scripts (.py files) and a text file (.txt). Each Python script is named in a numbered format followed by the concept it represents. For example, "01_print.py" is about Python's print function, "02_comment.py" is about how to write comments in Python, and so on.

## Key Directories and Files
As the repository consists of a single root directory, the key files to note are the Python scripts. Each script is standalone, demonstrating a specific aspect of Python programming. The text file "darkness.txt" is likely used as an input for the file handling script "28_filehandling.py".

## Frameworks and Libraries
No specific frameworks or libraries are identified to be used in this repository as it primarily focuses on core Python functionalities and concepts.
