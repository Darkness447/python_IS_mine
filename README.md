# python_IS_mine

This repository is a collection of Python files each demonstrating a different aspect of the Python language. Each file is an independent module and can be run individually to understand the specific concept it presents. No specific project type or framework is identified, and the repository seems to be a learning resource for Python programming language.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your local machine. If not, download and install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/python_IS_mine.git
```

## Usage Examples

Each file can be run individually to observe its functionality. For example, to run the '01_print.py' file, navigate to the directory containing the file and use the following command:

```
python 01_print.py
```

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as a set of Python files in the root directory. Each file corresponds to a different concept in Python. Here are some key files:

- `01_print.py` - Demonstrates Python's print functionality.
- `02_comment.py` - Shows how to write comments in Python.
- `14_functions.py` - Describes how functions work in Python.
- `21_Modules.py` - Explains how Python modules work.

And many more, each file named after the concept it presents.
