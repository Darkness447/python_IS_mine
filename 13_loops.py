# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string). 

# for x in array:

# we can also loop through string
# range function 
# The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.
# Note that range(6) is not the values of 0 to 6, but the values 0 to 5.

# range(2, 30, 3): the third parameter here is the till the value we want to increment 

# for x in range(6):
#   print(x)
# else:
#   print("Finally finished!") 

# else statement here is used to execute when the loop is finised 
# Note: The else block will NOT be executed if the loop is stopped by a break statement.
